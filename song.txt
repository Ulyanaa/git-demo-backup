That first night we were standing at your door
Fumbling for your keys, then I kissed you
And ask me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand, and I followed you
Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a star lit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

Now, we're sitting here in your living room
Telling stories while we share a drink or twoAnd there's a vision I've been holding in my mind
We're 65 and you ask
"When did I first know?" I always knew
